# Setting Up a Serverless Angular Project

This guide will help you set up a serverless application with an Angular frontend and a serverless backend hosted on AWS using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- **AWS Account**: Create an account on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) if you donâ€™t have one.
- **AWS CLI**: Install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface with your account details. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).
- **Node.js and npm**: Install Node.js and npm from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Angular CLI**: Install the Angular Command Line Interface. Instructions are available [here](https://angular.dev/tools/cli).

## Inital Setup

### Step 1: Setup the Repository

Download the project repository created for your class to your local machine if not already done.

- Command: `git clone https://github.com/ucmo-cs/Senior_Project_Team_Name.git`

Download this base project repo.

- Command: `git clone https://github.com/risen-one-technologies/senior-project-template.git`

Copy the contents to your project folder and push them to your repo.

- Command: `cp LICENSE /path/to/your/Senior_Project_Team_Name`
- Command: `cp README.md /path/to/your/Senior_Project_Team_Name`
- Command: `cp -r backend/ /path/to/your/Senior_Project_Team_Name`
- Command: `cp -r frontend/ /path/to/your/Senior_Project_Team_Name`
- Command: `cd /path/to/your/Senior_Project_Team_Name`
- Command: `git add .`
- Command: `git commit -m "Initial commit"`

## Backend Setup

### Step 1: Navigate to the backend folder

Navigate to the backend folder.

- Command: `cd backend`

### Step 2: Install Serverless Framework

Install the Serverless Framework, which will help you manage the serverless backend.

- Command: `npm install -g serverless`

### Step 3: Install Project Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies.

- Command: `npm install`

### Step 4: Configure Serverless Framework

1. Open the `serverless.yml` file in the backend directory.
2. Update the file with your AWS account details and configure the DynamoDB table if needed.
3. Ensure the table name in `serverless.yml` matches the table name used in your Lambda functions.

### Step 5: Deploy the Backend

Deploy the serverless application to AWS. This will set up the necessary AWS Lambda functions and DynamoDB tables.

- Command: `serverless deploy`

After deployment, note the API endpoints provided by the Serverless Framework.

### Step 6: Set Up Login Functionality

Follow these steps to configure the login functionality:

1. **Create the DynamoDB Table**:
   - The table is created with the name `users` and it has `username` as the primary key. This is defined in the `resources` section of the `serverless.yml` file.

2. **Add Users to the Table**:
   - Sample users are added to the DynamoDB table with predefined usernames and passwords. This ensures that you have users to test the login functionality.

3. **Lambda Function for Login**:
   - The Lambda function defined in `src/handlers/login.js` handles the login requests. It checks if the provided username and password match an existing user in the DynamoDB table.

### Lambda Function Code Explanation:

The Lambda function is responsible for handling login requests. Here's a breakdown of the code in [login.js](./backend/src/handlers/login.js):
- The function uses the AWS SDK to interact with DynamoDB.
- It reads the username and password from the request body.
- It retrieves the user from the DynamoDB table using the username.
- It checks if the user exists and if the password matches.
- It returns a success message if the login is successful or an error message if the login fails.
  
## Frontend Setup

### Step 1: Navigate to the frontend folder

Navigate to the frontend folder

- Command: `cd ../frontend`

### Step 2: Install Angular Project Dependencies

Navigate to the frontend directory of the project and install the necessary dependencies.

- Command: `npm install`

### Step 3: Develop and Build the Frontend

#### Run the Development Server

Start the development server to preview the Angular application locally.

- Command: `ng serve`

#### Build the Project

Build the project to prepare it for deployment. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/frontend` directory.

- Command: `ng build --prod`

### Step 4: Deploy the Frontend

#### Configure Backend Integration

Ensure that the build output directory (`dist/frontend`) is correctly set up in the backend serverless configuration. Refer to the backend README for more details on deploying the frontend with the backend.

#### Deploy to AWS S3

1. Create an S3 Bucket

Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service. Create a new bucket for your frontend files.

2. Upload Build Artifacts

After building the Angular project, upload the contents of the `dist/frontend` directory to the S3 bucket.

3. Configure Bucket Permissions

Set the appropriate permissions for the S3 bucket to allow public access to the files.

4. Enable Static Website Hosting

Enable static website hosting for the S3 bucket.

### Accessing Your Application

After deploying the frontend to S3 and setting up the backend on AWS, you can access your application through the S3 bucket URL provided in the static website hosting settings.
